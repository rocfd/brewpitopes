To predict N-glycosylations and O-glycosylations you should use the Net-N-Glyc and Net-O-Glyc servers.

N-glycosylations

O-glycosylations
https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetOGlyc-4.0


Once you have the outputs in .csv you can use epiglycan_extractor.R to extract the glycosylated residues.
Then, use epiglycan.py to label the glycosylated residues in epitopes.
